        Dear {{ member.firstName }},

    <p>
        Congratulations! You have qualified and been selected to be part of this summerâ€™s Future Rockstars Band Camp. We look forward to personally welcoming you at camp orientation. You and your guardian will be receiving all the help and information you need to ensure a smooth, comfortable transition into band camp life.

    {% elif type == 'waitlist' %}
    <p>
        We wanted to inform you that, while your submission was good, unfortunately it was not quite enough to make the cut. We have gone ahead and added you to our limited waitlist so that you still have a chance to get into the camp. Please get your paperwork and forms in order so that you will be ready if we call upon you. 
    </p>
    {% elif type == 'rejected' %}
    <p>
        Unfortunately, your submission did not make the cut for this camp. Do not take this personally as our program is not geared towards everyone and it may simply not be a good fit for your talents. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. 
    </p>

        {% endif %}
        <li>Your paperwork</li>
        <li>Yourself</li>
